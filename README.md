Why Are Custom Wine Cellars And Wines Great Investments? https://innovativesnc.squarespace.com/blog/2021/4/20/why-custom-wine-cellars-and-wines-are-great-investments
When people think of wine cellars, the image that appears before them is that of an old, haunted, historic, underground hall, with huge cobwebs woven between wooden barrels. This image is in keeping with the traditional European approach, where centuries-old cellars containing the finest Italian and French drinks await tourists. However, it wouldn't be easy to replicate it in an urban area. This is what brings modern, in-house wine cellars to life. In this article, we will introduce you to why these solutions are great investments.




What are modern-day wine cellars?




Wine cellars have evolved from being an underground basement room full of barrels to innovative products that are custom-built to fit your home, regardless of it being a house or an apartment. 




IMG_2127.JPG
Modern wine cellars have three different parts:
• A shelving system to store the bottles in a transparent manner

• Glass walls to separate this space from the room

• An air conditioning system that establishes and maintains the proper temperature





Why invest in wine?






Wine cellars are only useful if you have bottles of wine to showcase and preserve for either future occasions or sales. Most wine collectors naturally become investors as well. When their cellars are full, they sell a few bottles and make substantial, often surprising profits. 






Buying quality wines, especially French ones, have yielded higher returns in recent years than bonds, stocks, or even one of the most successful products of the last decade, gold. Wine indices, which are mainly composed of quality wines from Bordeaux, have shown an average increase of more than 20 percent per year during the last 5 years.






As wine becomes less and less simply a luxury item and increasingly serves as an investment vehicle, a wine exchange has already been set up in London and many wine investment funds are already on the market. 






When it comes to wines, the old, famous, and well-seasoned specialty bottles are of great value. The price of good quality wines is mainly determined by the fact, that over time, their supply decreases. 90 percent of wines are consumed in the first year after they are produced, while the demand for luxury goods is increasing, which is the reason for the skyrocketing profits of investors. 






In addition to the positive development in the past, the outlook is also promising: in the long term, further growth in demand is expected. The Sotheby's auction house, for instance, auctioned wine worth more than 92 million dollars in 2020. Demand for wine is boosted by the changing demographics of those interested in wine in recent years: While the average age of the clientele used to be between 60 and 65, it has now decreased to 40-45.






What do the best investment wines have in common?






The wine should be rated within the top 5% by one or more influential wine journals to be considered investment quality.

It is important to note that investment quality wines must be produced by wineries that have an unparalleled reputation, regardless of the consensus of critics. Newer entrants to the market are particularly affected by this.

It must reach its optimal maturity at least 10 years after bottling and should last at least 25 years. (Most non-investment wines are highly rated in their first year, and less than 1% last more than a decade).

Few (if any) investment-grade wines are produced in quantities greater than 20,000 cases.






How can wine cellars further increase the value of your collection?






Storing high-end wine bottles requires special equipment that helps preserve both the look and the contents. A custom wine cellar provides a larger space that allows homeowners to save money on storage.






Having the storage system in-house introduces a few other aspects:






Eventually, access to storage becomes much more convenient when it is managed in-house. 

You have 24/7 access to your collection and can review any item instantly, giving you a high level of visibility.

Looking at the big picture empowers you to identify potential gaps in your collections, which you can improve by acquiring the missing items. This way, you will have a complete overview of your wine treasure and can organize it according to your future plans.

Seeing your collection as a whole also gives you pleasure as you enjoy the stunning visuals. 

A high-quality, modern wine cellar increases the value of your property and opens the doors to a whole different audience, resulting in a faster sale. 






How to choose the right contractor to build a custom wine cellar for you?






Just as wine requires fine taste and special care, so does the wine cellar require a professional skill. The wine cellar is so much more than simple shelving and air conditioning. An experienced contractor understands how a wine cellar fits into your current home design. Our wine cellar builders will help you plan the size you need (based on your current and future collection), create a design that is able to enhance the current look while choosing a smart climate control system that adapts to the needs of the contents. Creating and building the necessary parts is only a matter of weeks, depending on the materials you choose.

Investing In A Custom Home Sauna: Is It Worth it? https://innovativesnc.squarespace.com/blog/2021/4/15/the-benefits-of-investing-in-a-custom-home-sauna
The sauna not only renews and refreshes the body, but also the soul. It can be a means of detoxification, an excellent stress reliever, and in some cases a special social experience. Depending on your goals, you can choose a traditional Finnish sauna or an infrared cabin. In this article, we will introduce you to the benefits of a custom sauna in your home.


The Brief History Of Saunas


The Finnish sauna is an ancient tradition, having been widely used there for many centuries. It dates back two thousand years. Its use was widespread until the 16th century, but due to a false belief that saunas spread disease, the tradition had almost completely disappeared. In terms of function, these cabins served various purposes, such as a laundromat, a place for religious ceremonies (physical, spiritual purification), and healing. We now know that the sauna was the most hygienic part of the house due to the heat and smoke, many women gave birth here at that time. Today they look different, but in Finland, you can still find the original sauna houses, smokehouses, and sauna cabins.


According to the earliest written records, naked Scandinavian people would pat themselves with a branch and then pour cold water on themselves. We can't know for sure that they were Finns, but today almost every Finnish household has a sauna because it's a common form of recreation for them. From the middle of the 20th century, interest and demand for sauna building increased all over the world, and since Finland played a crucial role in this, we consider it the home of the sauna.


Until the beginning of the 20th century, the smoke sauna was the most common type. Its disadvantages are that it took a long time to heat up, was much more flammable compared to modern saunas, and was also difficult to keep clean.


In the early 1900s, these were first replaced by chimney technology, where the smoke escaped through the stones into the chimney. This type has not developed much compared to the smoke sauna, so models with a separate chimney have been used for private and public saunas since the 1930s.


Sometimes the sauna replaces other bathing habits. In Japan, the sauna seems to take the place of the unusually hot water bath, the Japanese furo. The same tendency can be observed in Russia, where the steam bath (banja) is widely used.


In the 21st century, people enjoy the health benefits of saunas in spas, which naturally triggers the need to have the same experience privately at home.


Benefits for your health


A sauna is often associated with sweating and heat, but it is not common to understand the potential health benefits it can offer. What's the point of sweating in temperatures of 150-180 degrees Fahrenheit? This extremely high temperature may sound scary, but for a healthy body it is not harmful, in fact, it has a fantastic effect on your body. Many people report how comfortable they feel after a proper sauna session. Why is this the case? There are multiple factors that make it so beneficial. The first is the sweating itself and the pleasant effects it causes.


There is nothing wrong with sweating at the gym too, but what about those who don't feel like working out, and would rather relax after a long day's work? For them, the sauna is a top-notch solution, but if someone uses it as a supplement to exercise, the effect is even more beneficial. The sauna has a stimulating effect on our metabolism and helps in boosting weight loss. It is also especially recommended for regular athletes, because its use is equivalent to the effect of a refreshing massage, as the hot air amazingly relaxes the muscles, avoiding the unpleasant feeling of muscle fever, and decreasing the chance of an injury. 


One of the many benefits of sweating is it facilitates the process of detoxification. This state enables harmful substances to leave the body. The great heat and resulting steam expands our pores, which helps the body's toxins to escape faster. Therefore, it is vital to replenish fluids during sauna rituals to avoid dehydration.


Additionally, the sauna can also lead to a spectacular rejuvenation of the skin. The cause can be attributed to the fact that the toxins escape through sweating, and the old, thickened skin peels off, giving the skin a chance to start regenerating more quickly. Who doesn't want tight, fresh, and healthy skin?


In addition to helping keep your skin beautiful, regular sauna sessions can also help boost your immune system. Just consider how great it would be to avoid colds and flu in the winter, as your body would be completely protected against them. Science has proven that saunas aid in fighting diseases as heat results in a fever-like effect, stimulating the body to defend itself.


The benefits don’t end there! Apart from helping your body in countless ways, saunas also benefit your mind, as regular use helps relieve tension resulting in decreased stress. Researchers have found that in many cases, stress increases an individual's appetite unnecessarily. Those who are excited have higher carbohydrate cravings and are likely to overeat. All the above benefits have cross-effects on sauna users’ sleep habits, enabling them to fall asleep faster, and have more balanced REM phases. Living a stress-free life is important not only for our mental wellbeing but also for our physical health.


Many people have an aversion to a communal sauna ritual. Firstly, for hygienic reasons and secondly, because they would dislike sweating in front of others or standing in a bath towel queue. For those who don't want to opt for a communal sauna, the solution lies in buying a home unit.


Sauna types and how they work

Finnish sauna: In the traditional sauna, hot air is produced and maintained by heated stones, while the necessary humidity can be created by infusions on these stones. It combines elements of a Roman hot-air bath and a Turkish steam bath. Under the influence of the relatively warm air, between 167-194 degrees Fahrenheit, the body's detoxification mechanism is stimulated by sweating over the surface of the skin. Some people also enjoy the beneficial effects of the 110-degree air, exercising the heart and circulation. With regular use, metabolic processes and the elimination of waste products are significantly accelerated.

Steam bath: Historically, it can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, who used it for relaxation and refreshment. Its mode of operation is similar to that of the Turkish Hamam bath. The relative humidity is between 80-100%. The pores of the skin dilate at 100-120 degrees Fahrenheit, higher temperatures at this humidity would make the body unbearable. The dense air cleanses, nourishes, and regenerates epithelial tissue. Lungs and respiratory tract are cleared by the heat, blood circulation is promoted and the pulse is accelerated. Don't be fooled by the lower temperatures, because you sweat profusely in this type of sauna too. The big difference with the traditional sauna is that in the steam bath, your body doesn't cool itself down by evaporating sweat, so the internal target temperature is reached much faster. 

Infrared sauna: The only place where your body heats up from the inside out. It is like an incubator for the adult body. It can be used with various supplements, such as aromatherapy and color therapy, to improve the regeneration of the body at the same time. The pleasant warmth is comparable to the sand on the beach, warmed by the sun, which warms our bodies evenly. The skin gently warms up, the pores dilate and the infrared rays penetrate 1-1.5 inches deep under the skin into the muscles, joints, tissues and accelerate the flow of oxygen and blood circulation. Metabolism speeds up in the deep tissues, so it detoxifies much more effectively than a traditional sauna. At around 100-135 degrees Fahrenheit, it is less taxing on the body to detoxify than at higher temperatures. The air does not burn and does not cause your breathing to speed up.


The advantage of investing in a custom home sauna


Home saunas are often considered a luxury, especially if they are custom built. Although the price varies greatly depending on the materials used and desired functionality, the average quality sauna is now more than affordable. Investing in a custom home sauna offers great benefits, including an increase in the value of your property.

A spa experience with high-end pampering is an intimate method of relaxation that you may not want to share with strangers. With a home sauna, you can bring the experience home and finally take full control of the essential oils and sauna infusion music. Your options are endless, from citrus and Backstreet Boys to winter scents and classical composers.

Enjoy the peace and quiet during the ritual, or invite friends and family over to relax together. Modern mobile devices can't withstand the heat of the Finnish sauna, so guests will no longer hear the beep of TikTok or work emails, and will be more present in the moment.

A custom home sauna can increase the value of your property in a proportion that depends on many factors. Even with a small tweak to the interior design, you can create the feeling of a luxury spa in your basement. If the location attracts a receptive audience, they will consider the sauna a high-end addition to your property.
 

A less obvious factor, but custom-built equipment can also radically shorten the time to sell. Especially in a neighborhood with many similar buildings, it is difficult to stand out in the real estate market. Not only does a sauna help advertise broader overall functionality, but it provides a variety of staging options, resulting in value-added, stunning interior photos.

It is a common misconception that a home sauna costs a fortune to run. When installed with infrared panels, your sauna's electricity consumption will cost around $5 per month when used for an hour a day, which is less than the price of a Big Mac burger. 

The sauna and associated equipment are easy to maintain.
